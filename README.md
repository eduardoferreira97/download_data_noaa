<h1 align="center">Download Data from GOES-17/GOES-16</h1>

Code created based on ready script from <b><a href="https://gist.github.com/blaylockbk/d60f4fce15a7f0475f975fc57da9104d#file-download_goes_aws-py">Brian Blaylock</a></b>. 
I added lines to help with the continuous data download, there is still a lot to be added. In case of lack of data the library itself returns an error message and for the download.
